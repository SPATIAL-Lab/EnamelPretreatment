# EnamelPretreatment
A series of experiments on tooth enamel targeting three sample preparation options: particle size (course versus fine), storage conditions, and oxidant solutions (eight different treatment variations). Changes (or lack thereof) of d13C values, d18O values, and CO3 yield are observed and discussed.
